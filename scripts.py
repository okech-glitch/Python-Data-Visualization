# A python script is basically just a text file in which you input your Python code in order to build a larger application. 

# Since the python interpreter is suitable for small tasks and chunks of code only, 
# python scripts allow you to build programs having hundreds or thousands of lines of code,
#  make changes to your code and run it as many times as you want.

# The python file must have the .py extension, not .txt or anything else. 

print("Hello World!")
